Search Engine built on top of Google's Page Rank algorithm | Solr Lucene Search Tool

- Designed a Solr based Web Search Engine that returns relevant results for the user's query using either Solr's default Lucene search tool or Googleâ€™s Page Rank algorithm based on user preferences. 
- Solr's default Lucene search tool returns search results from indexed web pages based on the Vector Space Model and the Boolean Model. 
- Facilitated search through Google's renown PageRank algorithm that ranks web pages according to the number of legitimate sites that link web pages by first computing the PageRank on network graph for indexed web pages constructed using the NetworkX library.
- Developed the user interface through HTML/CSS, Javascript,JQuery and Bootstrap and PHP script for back end query processing including spell correction and auto completion.
